[![Semaphore CI](https://bigbinary.semaphoreci.com/badges/wheel.svg)](https://bigbinary.semaphoreci.com/projects/wheel)

Made by the team at [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com), this is a base project to quickly spin up a
Rails application built with opinions of BigBinary style of working.

## Local Development Setup

Install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version.
Make sure that [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed with it as well.

```
./bin/setup
```

Start the server by executing following command.

```
bundle exec rails server
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and login with email `sam@example.com` and password `welcome`.

## Replace Wheel with your project name

Let's say that the project name is `Pump`. Execute the command below to
replace all occurrences of `Wheel` with `Pump`.

```
perl -pi -w -e 's/Wheel/Pump/g;' $(git ls-files)
```
