[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/bigbinary/wheel.png?style=badge)](https://circleci.com/gh/bigbinary/wheel)

Made by the team at [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com), this is a base project to quickly spin up a
Rails application built with opinions of BigBinary style of working.

## Local Development Setup

Install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version. Make sure that [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed with it as well.

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake setup
bin/yarn
bundle exec rails server
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and login with email sam@example.com and password welcome.

##  Running with Docker

### Pre-Requesites

Make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### Starting rails

```
docker-compose up
```

After the container is successfully created you should be able to access your app on `http://localhost:9000`

### Deploy wheel on Kubernetes

Deploy wheel on kubernetes using [this templates](https://github.com/bigbinary/wheel/tree/master/lib/templates/kubernetes).

You will need access to the working [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) locally
and setup kubeconfig.

If you dont have k8s cluster setup,
simply install [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).

Run following commands to deploy wheel on k8s.

Create postgres db and service.

`kubectl create -f db-deployment.yml -f db-service.yml`

Create configmap for database.yml.

`kubectl create -f database-configmap.yml`

Create web/puma deployment and service.

`kubectl create -f web-deployment.yml -f web-service.yml`

Create background/delayed_job deployment and service.

`kubectl create -f background-deployment.yml -f background-service.yml`

Get application endpoint.

```
$ kubectl get svc web -o wide | awk '{print $4}'
a55714dd1a22d11e88d4b0a87a399dcf-2144329260.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

## Replace Wheel with your project name

Let's say that the project name is `Pump`. Execute the command below to
replace all occurrences of `Wheel` with `Pump`.

```
perl -e "s/Wheel/Pump/g;" -pi $(find . -type f)
```
