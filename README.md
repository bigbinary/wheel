[![Build Status](https://bigbinary.semaphoreci.com/badges/wheel/branches/master.svg?style=shields)](https://bigbinary.semaphoreci.com/projects/wheel)

Made by the team at [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com), this is a base project to quickly spin up a
Rails application built with opinions of BigBinary style of working.

## Local Development Setup

Clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/bigbinary/wheel.git`.

Install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version `v16.4.2` which we have specified inside the `.node-version` file.

```bash
nvm install
```

Make sure that [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is installed with it as well.

```bash
./bin/setup
```

Start the server by executing following command.

```bash
bundle exec rails server
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and login with email `oliver@example.com` and password `welcome`.

## Docker for development environment

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/bigbinary/wheel.git`.
- `cd wheel`
- If using it for the first time, run `docker-compose build` to build the images.
- Run `docker-compose run --rm web rails setup` to create and seed the database.
- Run `docker-compose up` to start the application and get things up and running.
- From now onwards, we can just run `docker-compose up` from within the root of the `wheel` directory to bring up the application.

#### Build images without using cache

While re-building images, docker tries to find it's layers in the cache, which might bring-in stale layers.

```bash
# this forces docker to not use cached image layers
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Steps to remove docker data related to wheel

Run `docker ps -a | grep wheel` to get containers related to wheel. Then run `docker rm -f $(docker ps -a | grep wheel | awk '{print $1}')` to delete them.

Run `docker images | grep wheel` to get images related to wheel. Then run `docker rmi -f $(docker images | grep wheel | awk '{print $3}')` to delete them.

Run `docker volume ls | grep wheel` to get volumes related to wheel. Then run `docker volume rm -f $(docker volume ls | grep wheel | awk '{print $2}')` to delete them.

### Steps to nuke all data and start fresh

If you want to try out something slightly more daring, yet effective, then run the following single line command to wipe all of the docker data including containers, images, volumes.

**Warning: The following command will wipe all of docker data of all local docker projects and containers:**

```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rmi -f $(docker images -q) && docker volume rm -f $(docker volume ls -q)
docker-compose up --build
```

Run `docker system prune -a -f --volumes` to remove all containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and volumes.

## Replace Wheel with your project name

Let's say that the project name is `Pump`. Execute the command below to
replace all occurrences of `Wheel` with `Pump`.

```bash
perl -pi -w -e 's/Wheel/Pump/g;' $(git ls-files)
perl -pi -w -e 's/wheel/Pump/g;' $(git ls-files)
```
